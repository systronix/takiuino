# Takiuino - the arduino board for ME!

Just a WIP atm, look in the eagle directory and you can see the boards and their OSHPark links

The main site for the takiuino is here: http://pjr.cc/tu/ (which is comming soon (tm))

## Thanks go to....

Maniacbug - for his work on the 1284 originally. (https://maniacbug.wordpress.com/2011/11/27/arduino-on-atmega1284p-4/
The Optiboot folk - for making the awesome optiboot code! (https://code.google.com/p/optiboot/)

## What is it?

A fork of Maniacbug's mighty1284 code base, also includes the 644p code.

I've removed everything except the optiboot options (for now, the others may return)

## What do you need?

First you need the board, which is on oshpark [here](https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/BunCIt50)

Then you need to make the board (its pretty simple)

....

## installation

copy the contents of the arduino-ide folder into you arduino ide's hardware directory
